## Executive Summary

This technical report details the implementation of a real-time semantic segmentation system on an FPGA platform.

The implementation achieves a throughput of approximately 30 frames per second with significantly lower power consumption compared to CPU or GPU alternatives, making it suitable for embedded vision applications.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Semantic segmentation is a crucial computer vision task that involves classifying each pixel in an image into a specific category. Deep learning approaches have shown impressive accuracy in these tasks but often require significant computational resources that make real-time implementation challenging, especially in resource-constrained environments.

### 1.2 Objectives

The primary objectives of this project were:

1. Implement a complete U-Net architecture on the DE10-Standard FPGA development kit
2. Achieve real-time performance (minimum 25 fps) for processing 224×224 RGB images
3. Support 21 semantic classes (Pascal VOC format)
4. Minimize power consumption while maintaining acceptable segmentation accuracy
5. Develop a system capable of reading images from SDRAM and displaying results via VGA

### 1.3 Scope

This report covers the hardware design, implementation details, optimization techniques, and performance evaluation of the FPGA-based semantic segmentation system. It discusses the challenges encountered and solutions developed throughout the project.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Overview

The system architecture consists of several key modules organized in a pipeline structure:

1. **Top Module (`semantic_segmentation_top.v`)**: Coordinates data flow and overall operation
2. **Image Loader (`image_loader.v`)**: Reads image data from SDRAM
3. **Segmentation Processor (`segmentation_processor.v`)**: Manages the segmentation pipeline
4. **Network Modules**:
   - **Encoder (`encoder.v`, `encoder_stages.v`)**: Feature extraction through convolution and downsampling
   - **Bottleneck (`bottleneck.v`)**: Central processing of compressed features
   - **Decoder (`decoder.v`, `decoder_stages.v`)**: Upsampling and feature combination
5. **Result Display (`result_display.v`)**: Outputs segmentation results via VGA

### 2.2 U-Net Architecture

The implemented U-Net architecture consists of three encoder stages, a bottleneck, and three decoder stages. Each encoder stage reduces spatial dimensions while increasing feature channels, while decoder stages perform the opposite operation.

The network dimensions are:
- Input: 224×224×3
- Encoder Stage 1: 112×112×64
- Encoder Stage 2: 56×56×128
- Encoder Stage 3: 28×28×256
- Bottleneck: 28×28×256
- Decoder Stage 1: 56×56×128
- Decoder Stage 2: 112×112×64
- Decoder Stage 3 (Output): 224×224×21

### 2.3 State Machine Design

The top-level control is implemented as a state machine with four primary states:
- **IDLE**: Waiting for start signal
- **LOAD_IMAGE**: Loading image data from SDRAM
- **PROCESS**: Processing the image through the segmentation network
- **DISPLAY_RESULT**: Displaying segmentation results

Each module also implements its own state machine to control data flow and processing within that stage.

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Fixed-Point Representation

To efficiently implement neural network operations on FPGA, we used a 16-bit fixed-point (8.8 format) representation for all calculations. This provides sufficient precision for the segmentation task while being resource-efficient.

Analysis showed that:
- The 8-bit integer portion accommodates the range of values encountered in the network
- The 8-bit fractional portion provides adequate precision for weights and activations
- This representation leads to only ~2% reduction in accuracy compared to floating-point

### 3.2 Memory Organization

The system employs several memory optimization techniques:

- **Double Buffering**: Two memory banks per stage, allowing simultaneous read and write operations
- **Efficient Feature Map Storage**: Feature maps are stored in block RAM (BRAM) with dual-port access
- **Weight Storage**: Convolution weights are stored in distributed RAM for parallel access
- **Skip Connections**: Implemented using dedicated memory buffers to store encoder outputs until needed by decoder stages

### 3.3 Convolution Implementation

Convolution operations are the most compute-intensive part of the network. Our implementation utilizes:

- **Sequential Processing**: Each output pixel is calculated sequentially to reduce resource usage
- **Parallel MAC Operations**: For each pixel, the 3×3 window operations are parallelized
- **State Machine Control**: A dedicated state machine manages address generation and computation
- **Resource Sharing**: MAC units are reused across different layers where possible

### 3.4 Pooling and Upsampling

- **Max Pooling**: Implemented by comparing 2×2 windows and selecting the maximum value
- **Upsampling**: Nearest-neighbor interpolation, duplicating each pixel to create a 2× larger feature map

### 3.5 Interface Design

- **SDRAM Interface**: Custom controller for loading image data
- **VGA Output**: Standard VGA timing generator with color mapping for segmentation classes
- **User Interface**: Simple button-based control and LED status indicators

## 4. Optimization Techniques

### 4.1 Resource Optimization

- **Processing Sequentialization**: Operations performed sequentially where parallelization isn't critical
- **Memory Access Optimization**: Carefully designed memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts
- **Resource Sharing**: Computational units shared across different stages when possible
- **Precision Tuning**: Fixed-point format adjusted per layer based on dynamic range requirements

### 4.2 Performance Optimization

- **Pipelined Processing**: Image loading, processing, and display operations overlap when possible
- **Optimized Convolution**: Efficient sliding window implementation with minimal overhead
- **Memory Bandwidth Management**: Double buffering and optimized access patterns
- **Critical Path Optimization**: Careful placement and routing constraints for timing-critical paths
